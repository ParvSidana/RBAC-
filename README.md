# **RBAC System**

This repository implements a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system with secure authentication, authorization, and user role management.

- **Authentication**:
  - User login, registration, and logout.
  - JWT-based authentication for secure session management.

# Key Middleware

### `verifyJWT`

This middleware validates the JWT token to ensure that the user is authenticated. It checks if the request contains a valid JWT token and, if valid, attaches the user data to `req.user`. This is essential for protecting routes and ensuring that only authenticated users can access them.

### `verifyAdmin`

This middleware checks if the userâ€™s role is `Admin`. It is used to protect routes like `/admin` and `/update-role` from unauthorized access. If the user is not an Admin, they will be denied access to these routes.

### `verifyModerator`

This middleware ensures that only users with the `Moderator` role can access routes like `/moderator`. If the user does not have the Moderator role, they will be denied access to these routes.
